Need: (what need does this app fulfill)
We need to prove to our ISP that the speeds and 
reliability that they are claiming to be providing 
do not match what we are receiving.

Purpose:
This app will test both the ping times and the speeds of a network
and collate that data into a databse.


Design:
The service:
The service must reliably continue to run once run
The service must reliably store the data to the database

The Database:
   Central Design:
      iplookup Table:
         ID
         timeCreated
         ipv4
         domain name
      clientlookup Table:
         ID
         LAN ipv4
         computerName
      Pings Table:
         ID
         ping_value
         DateTime tested
         ipv4_id
         client_id
      speed Table:
         ID
         datetime tested
         raw downspeed_value
         raw upspeed value
         client_id
      ===========================================
      Local Design:
      iplookup Table:
         ID
         timeCreated
         ipv4
         domain name
      Pings Table:
         ID
         ping_value
         DateTime tested
         ipv4_id
      speed Table:
         ID
         datetime tested
         raw downspeed_value
         raw upspeed value
         
The database may be run on a singular machine to accept data from multiple services
   IF their is a central DB :
      The central database must store the LAN IP of the device or another unuiqe identifier along with the data described in the DB Design
      Their must be a backup local DB store incase the service is running standalone or cannot reach the main server.
